# Hey there! 👋🏽

I'm Alisha, and here's a bit about me:

- I study Data Science at UMass Amherst, with a particular interest in computational linguistics.
- I just presented my very first paper at ICML MemFM, OWL: Probing Cross-Lingual Recall of Memorized Texts via World Literature. Read it at https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22945. 
- I'm passionate about AI research, particularly in multilingual NLP, memorization, and ethical AI.
- Outside of work, I'm obsessed with elegant & intutive products, leading UMass Product as President, and occasionally plotting a fashion tech startup.
- & not to forget, I got my start in crypto quant. Despite my pivot to AI, blockchain tech is a emerging asset class I am very excited about. 

If you’re building something cool or just want to talk applied AI, cool products, or undergrad research, feel free to reach out at alishasrivas@umass.edu!
I hope you learned a bit about me, and Go Warriors! 🌁
