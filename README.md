# Hey there! 👋🏽

I'm Alisha, and here's a bit about me:

- 🎓 I study Data Science at UMass Amherst, with a particular interest in computational linguistics.
- I just presented my very first paper at ICML MemFM:
 **OWL: Probing Cross-Lingual Recall of Memorized Texts via World Literature**. 📖 Read it here → [arxiv.org/abs/2505.22945](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22945)
- I'm passionate about AI research, particularly in multilingual NLP, AI security, and ethical AI.
- Outside of work, I'm obsessed with elegant & intutive products, as President of UMass Product.
- & not to forget, I got my start in crypto quant. Despite my pivot to AI, blockchain tech is a space & emerging asset class I am very excited about. 

If you’re building something cool or just want to talk applied AI, cool products, or undergrad research, feel free to reach out at alishasrivas@umass.edu!
